# removing-pos-vit-bias
Using Franca's RASA to remove positional bias in of other SSL pretrained ViTs, since the original codebase takes effort to be adapted and more pre-trained SSL encoders would benefit.

TODO: 
- ~~Add segmentation evaluation~~
- Benchmark before and after
- Test integration of RASA into the network
- Visualizations of the feature maps, PCA, consine similarity map on the same images.
- Add patch evaluation
- Post-training high(er)-resolution method gram-anchors?
